I've found the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensourcepos/][opernsourcepos]] software very useful. This fork contains some chagnes to it to meet my needs.

* What has changed?
- Sales comments appear on the receipt.
- New Payment Details field (e.g. for last 4 digits of credit card or check number). Prints on receipt.
- All customer data is printed on the receipt.
